# Calculations of the PI

> This module is part of the "Good to Know" series on my portfolio page. The series explores fascinating concepts and real-world insights through interactive visualization and components.

It shows several methods to calculate the value of the PI. I know there are several sites in the universities about this, but it was one of my first calculations when I started to look for these kind of interesting facts.

- The first 5000 decimal of the π, because it can come in handy at any time.
- The Ratio method
- The Gregory - Leibnitz formula
- Ramanujan formula (under development)
- Machin formula (under development)
- Monte Carlo method

If you know about other method, or something to add here, feel free to contribute.
